# Linux Package Management Lab Using APT

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the Advanced Package Tool (APT) to manage software packages in a Linux environment. The lab was completed in a Qwiklabs environment using the Bash shell and focused on installing, uninstalling, verifying, and reinstalling network security applications commonly used by security analysts.

---

## Scenario

As a security analyst, it is important to understand how to install and manage security tools on Linux systems. In this lab, I used APT to install, remove, and verify the status of two network security applications: **Suricata** and **tcpdump**.

---

## Objectives

* Confirm APT is installed
* Install Suricata using APT
* Verify Suricata installation
* Uninstall Suricata
* Verify Suricata removal
* Install tcpdump using APT
* List installed packages
* Reinstall Suricata
* Verify both applications are installed

---

## Environment

* Platform: Qwiklabs
* Operating System: Linux
* Shell: Bash
* Package Manager: APT (Advanced Package Tool)

---

## Commands Used

### Confirm APT Installation

```bash
apt
```

### Install Suricata

```bash
sudo apt install suricata
```

### Verify Suricata Installation

```bash
suricata
```

### Remove Suricata

```bash
sudo apt remove suricata
```

### Verify Suricata Removal

```bash
suricata
```

### Install tcpdump

```bash
sudo apt install tcpdump
```

### List Installed Packages

```bash
apt list --installed
```

### Reinstall Suricata

```bash
sudo apt install suricata
```

### Final Verification

```bash
apt list --installed
```

### Task 6: Installed tcpdump

Successfully installed tcpdump for packet capture and network traffic analysis.

### Task 7: Listed Installed Packages

Viewed installed packages using APT.

### Task 8: Reinstalled Suricata

Successfully reinstalled Suricata using APT.

### Task 9: Final Verification

Verified that both Suricata and tcpdump were installed on the system.
